<h1 id="test">The cause of this felicitous state of affairs, we are told, is the ever increasing use of ever more efficient capital instruments. These tend constantly and endlessly to raise the "productivity of labor," and thus account for an ever increasing output of goods and services per worker employed. The principal guide to management and labor in negotiating these perpetually increasing wages is that "wage increases and benefits should be consistent with productivity prospects and with the maintenance of a stable dollar." Labor leaders are in full agreement with this principle. They openly and frankly support technological advances which in turn raise the "productivity of labor," which in turn calls for increases in wages to provide the mass purchasing power to support the mass production, etc.</h1>
