# Coperformace 
Is a example project of the Coperformace framework
## Windows machine run
 * open terminal
 * explore to file root directory of project
  * use cd to change the directory
  * use dir to get a list of directories
 * once in the file directory we need to tell terminal which node version to used
 * ``` nvmw use 0.10.32 ``` (this is from memmory)
  * if that fails find out which version of node exist on the machine type ``` nvmw list ``` or ``` nvmw ls ``` or ``` nvmw -ls ``` I don't remember...
 * ``` node main.js ``` -- this starts the application, if you go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) the app should be up.
 * you may need to change some of the reference links in the application -- we'll write how later...
